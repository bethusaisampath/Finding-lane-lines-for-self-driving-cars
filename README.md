# Finding-lane-lines-for-self-driving-cars
Self-driving cars, have rapidly become one of the most transformation technologies to emerge. Fueled by Deep Learning algorithms, they are continuously driving our society forward, and creating new opportunities in the mobility sector. In this project, I have used Computer Vision techniques via Open CV to identify lane lines for a self-driving car.
